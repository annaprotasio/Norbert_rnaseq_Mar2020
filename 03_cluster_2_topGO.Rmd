## Genes from clusters

We are follwoing up using the most stringent setting of clustering; that is to consider only those genes wit p > 0.90 (third plot in **Clustering** tab). 

Gene ids were pulled from each cluster and saved to an XLS file. Gene lists from each individual cluster can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1b8_mIJJojNMLXFr6KGw7WBHiqLgp5uny). 

Clusters were also grouped by "shape" and according to NV. There were two groups of clusters:

* group 1 => clusters 1,4
* group 2 => clusters 2,3,5,7

Genes in these groups of clusters are also printed to XLS file, same folder as above. 

## TopGO analysis

More information about [TOPGO](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/topGO/inst/doc/topGO.pdf). 

TopGo analysis has been done on the individual clusters as well as in grouped clusters. Results are in [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1b8_mIJJojNMLXFr6KGw7WBHiqLgp5uny)
