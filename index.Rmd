## Description of tabs

**Mapping and Counting**

Describes the methods used for mapping reads to refence genome, counting reads over gene features. Contains the environment.yml files for setting up correct Conda environments to reproduce the results. 

**Differential Expression**

As in the title, analysis performed using DESeq2. I've included a video on how to retrieve gene descriptions from BioMart.
