## Description of tabs

**Mapping and Counting**

Describes the methods used for mapping reads to refence genome, counting reads over gene features. Contains the environment.yml files for setting up correct Conda environments to reproduce the results. 

**Differential Expression**

As in the title, analysis performed using DESeq2. I've included a video on how to retrieve gene descriptions from BioMart.

**Cluster analysis**

This is done using MBCluster.seq. Genes are grouped into clusters according to their expression pattern. 

**GO enrichment**

Used TopGO algorithm implemented in R to find out which GO terms are enriched in the different clusters and groups of clusters. Results are presented in XLS.
